## Acknowledgement
This codebase is intended strictly for educational purposes. 

This project is a result of sleepless nights and incorporating knowledge and guidance from various online tutorials and guides available online. I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the following resources, whose insights and instructions have significantly contributed to the development of this project:

1. **The Best UI Components that EVERYONE is Using! by codeSTACKr**

2. **The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele**

3. **Full Stack E-Commerce + Dashboard & CMS: Next.js 13 App Router, React, Tailwind, Prisma, MySQL by Code With Antonio**

4. **Next.js 14 Full Crash Course by JavaScript Mastery**

While the majority of the code structure and concepts are derived from the tutorial, I have made several adaptations to meet the specific requirements and goals of my project. These adaptations include:

1. **Customization of Styling**: The styling, originally implemented with Tailwind CSS, has been modified to align with the visual design preferences of my project.
2. **Error Handling and Troubleshooting:** I felt like my hair is about to turn grey and fall all over the place because of the amount of errors I encountered while doing this project, yet somehow felt fulfilled since I was able to debug through my code and fix the errors with perseverance. I cried several times but, yes.
3. **Discovery fuels progress** I somehow experimented through the code in a separate repository. Might take months or even years to master the entire tools used in this project, but small progress is what matters at least. Prolly should establish a new project using these technologies.
