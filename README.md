## Acknowledgement
This codebase is intended strictly for educational purposes. 

This project is a result of sleepless nights and incorporating knowledge and guidance from various online tutorials and guides available online. I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the following resources, whose insights and instructions have significantly contributed to the development of this project:

1. **The Best UI Components that EVERYONE is Using! by codeSTACKr**

While the majority of the code structure and concepts are derived from the tutorial, I have made several adaptations to meet the specific requirements and goals of my project. These adaptations include:

1. **Customization of Styling**: The styling, originally implemented with Tailwind CSS, has been modified to align with the visual design preferences of my project.
